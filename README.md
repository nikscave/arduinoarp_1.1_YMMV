# arduinoarp_1.1
Revision 1.1 of the arpeggiator module based on Arduino nano
 Link to original project (https://www.ymnkmusic.com/diy-synths/arpeggiator/)


Updates from YourModulesMayVary:

Amended to work with push buttons using a 4067 Multiplexor and a couple of 74HC595 Shift registers.
Schematic looks noisy but its a really simple build, just lots of buttons and LEDS's.

TO DO - 4067 can take longer than time to notice the trigger, I use gates for now. Needs optimising? perhaps interupts or something else?!
