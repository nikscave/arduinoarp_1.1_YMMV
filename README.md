# arduinoarp_1.1
Revision 1.1 of the arpeggiator module based on Arduino nano
Link to original project (https://www.ymnkmusic.com/diy-synths/arpeggiator/)


Updates from YourModulesMayVary:

Amended to work with push buttons using a 4067 Multiplexor and a couple of 74HC595 Shift registers.
Schematic looks noisy but its a really simple build, just lots of buttons an LEDS's.
